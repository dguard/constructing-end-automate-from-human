human should have enough well-grown hand with sequence reflects (programmer, pianist)

human should have mathematic background including ability of in-memory calculation

### independent workflows

bind hand with vertical bounce handler on movement inside a car

bind hand reflects with vertical bounce handler (created from horse) movements recorded by camera
